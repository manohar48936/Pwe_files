# PwC Switzerland Power BI Job Simulation - August 2024

## Overview

Welcome to my repository for the **PwC Switzerland Power BI Job Simulation**, which I completed in August 2024 through Forage. This experience allowed me to sharpen my Power BI skills by tackling real-world business challenges. I worked with HR data to create dashboards and generate actionable insights, simulating the process of responding to client needs and requests.

## What I Learned
- **Power BI:** I created visually appealing and interactive dashboards to track key performance indicators (KPIs) that meet client needs.
- **Data Visualization & Analysis:** I analyzed HR data to highlight trends and identify key issues, like gender balance at the executive level.
- **Client Communication:** I crafted concise and impactful emails to engagement partners, presenting data-backed insights and recommendations.
- **Problem Solving:** I took a deep dive into gender-related KPIs, identifying causes for the disparities and suggesting ways to improve gender balance in leadership.
